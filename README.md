<p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/PJF33az" alt="logo"/></p>

This project was created as a challenge for [ZEBU](https://www.zebu.io/).
It’s a pizza delivery app ,where the user can customize its pizza.

Regarding the layout, some dummy stuff was added just to make the project look more like a complete application, instead of just showing the required components.

## Project Features

* Framework:  [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). A framework for building native apps using React.js. React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.

* Library:  [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). Chosen because it is a powerful library that is built with a reactive way of thinking. This project uses functional components and React Hooks, as a way to show capability to work with latest updates of this library.

* [Expo](https://expo.io/): it's a tool for React Native who gives easy access to devices native API without the need to touch in native code.

* Type checking: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  Is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for a better standardized code.

* Well moduled and componentially structured.

* Commits following a [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) structure for easier maintenance and automatic changelog/versioning.
